> An ERP invoice exception agent that investigates, cites its evidence, and
> proposes -- but cannot post.

This does not solve accounts-payable exception handling. Organisations buy that
from vendors with implementation teams. This is a portfolio system demonstrating
agent architecture, grounding discipline, and measurable guardrails against a
realistic ERP process.
